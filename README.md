# Black-Friday-Sales-Data-Analysis

<h1><strong>About Dataset</strong></h1>
<p>The dataset used in this analysis contains information of transactions in a store on Black Friday, including customers demographical features and transaction details. In this analysis I will do two things. Firstly I will explore the data and find some correlations between differents elements, so I can get some insights for future marketing strategies. On top of that I will also use regression method to predict future purchase</p>
